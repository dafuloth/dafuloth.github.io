There are a whole bunch of dev bootcamps to choose from in London. Yesterday I visited my top two choices for dev bootcamps. Flatiron School had a campus tour session at 12pm and Makers had a Q&A at 6:30pm.

Trying to stump up as much as £8000 upfront is a big ask.

Anyway, after taking a look at where I would be learning and asking lots of questions, the ranking is as follows:

1. Makers Fellowship (FREE!)
2. Flatiron School Software Engineering Immersive (£10000. Deferred tuition model. Upfront cost: £1000 deposit)
3. Makers Academy (£8000)
