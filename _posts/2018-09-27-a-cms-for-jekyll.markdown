Jekyll is wonderful. When GitHub Pages launched, it was exactly what I was looking for. What I felt was missing was decent CMS for writing, managing and updating posts.  I found it was awkward having to write, commit and push to GitHub everytime I wanted to post something on my blog. Writing is what I want to do on my blog so it's the only thing I want to focus on. First I tried [Prose](http://prose.io/) but found it too simplistic. Now I'm using [Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com) and I don't think I'll ever want to leave...

### About Jekyll...
It's lightweight and is quite easy to use, after some setup and configuration. When all I want is somewhere to write stuff it's perfect. Before static site generators were a thing, popular ways to have blog were sites like Blogger or WordPress.

Jekyll has changed everything. Unlike Blogger, I feel a greater sense of ownership and my blog truly feels like it's *mine*. And unlike WordPress, Jekyll is lighter and doesn't come with all the baggage of WordPress.

In short, with Blogger I didn't feel like I had enough control, and while WordPress did give me full control over all aspects of my blog it was overkill for what I wanted to do.

### Why Jekyll
If not for Jekyll, in time I might have begrudgingly gone with WordPress. But let me talk more on the "overkill" aspect. WordPress is a dynamic blog. Dynamic because of php backed by a MySQL database. On a practical note, the things that make WordPress dynamic are also what introduce security vulnerabilities, so I would have to keep up to date with latest updates. With a static blog, I don't have to worry about any of that and still have everything I want from a blogging system.

If I need any dynamic features like a comment system or email form, there are plenty of external services I can embed.

### The CMS
For me, the major advantage of WordPress is that it's got a great CMS (Content Management System). Because I wasn't fond of the write/commit/push cycle every time I wanted to post, I ended up not posting much. More specifically, I wasn't keen on having to do it myself. I wanted to be able to just write, click a button and be done with it. So what I needed was some web based system to manage my blog. What I needed was a CMS. For a while I tried Prose. Now I use Siteleaf.
