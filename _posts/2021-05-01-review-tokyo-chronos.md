excerpt: >-
  One thing I've done during this Bank Holiday weekend is to finally finish
  *Tokyo Chronos*. It's amazing. Playing it on and off, I have finally completed
  the game over a period of about three months, seeing all the endings and
  unlocking the true ending.


  Of the three VR games I've played since I got my Quest 2, this one has taken the longest to complete because to get the most out of it, you do actually have to read and understand the story (duh! it's a novel). It's my favourite game I've played so far.

## Not everyone's cup of tea

*Tokyo Chronos* is a visual novel so you don't play it the way you would an action game or RPG. Unlike the former, the latter is less about you and entirely about the story - which you may or may not be able to relate to.

Like how you would play (watch) a movie or play (listen) to music, playing (reading) a visual novel it's all about the experience, what it makes you think, and how it makes you feel.

On the Oculus store page, some of the negative reviews seem to be from people who did not find the kind of game they were expecting, i.e. a typical action/adventure game. In my book, I would say a game is any kind of interactive media where you can make choices to affect the outcome.

Perhaps it might help to think of *Tokyo Chronos* not as a videogame but as interactive fiction. Growing up, I used to love choose-your-own-adventure gamebooks, which were books that you could play by reading them. I was especially fond of the *Fighting Fantasy* series by Steve Jackson, and the *Lone Wolf* series by Joe Dever. I still read *Lone Wolf*, because they are officially available for free online.

I'm not that familiar with visual novels. I think I've played a little *Ace Attorney* but my first real experience of visual novels prior to *Tokyo Chronos* was *Doki Doki Literature Club.* DDLC only uses the format and mechanics of visual novels for its gameplay but it's *actually not your typical visual novel.* 

Still, I think it's introduced me to some of the conventions of visual novels, or at least the conventions of a specific genre of visual novel. Either way, you have to play through it multiple times to unlock different endings, which in the end allow you to unlock a true ending.

## An amazing story



## Verdict

Tokyo Chronos is one of the premium titles, going by the price tiers in the Oculus store, and I think justifiably so considering that it's fully voice-acted (albeit in Japanese). My sole criticism, and this just nitpicking, is that there are a lot of spelling mistakes in the English subtitles - but this doesn't affect comprehension of the text or detract from the overall experience.
