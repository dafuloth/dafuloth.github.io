The adviser was helpful and in end the matter was resolved. However, I would suggest that advisers be more knowledgeable regarding Amazon Coins. They were not sure about how I could apply my remaining Coins balance to the purchase of an app costing more than what I had. Eventually we confirmed that this was not possible and that the only way to spend all of my remaining 205 Coins was to buy something exactly 205 coins, or else buy 500 more coins and then ultimately end up in the same situation.

This chat was concerning my one, and now for the foreseeable future, only purchase of  Amazon Coins. It was with this purchase that I became a "paying customer" of the Amazon AppStore. I used to only use the Amazon AppStore for the free "app of the day". I normally buy from the Google Play Store. From now on, unless Amazon is selling an app at a lower price, I'll be sticking with Google Play.

Of my 1000 coin purchase, I had 205 coins remaining. Admittedly, I perhaps should have read the T&C/fine print more carefully so that I'd have understood that unless I make App Store purchases exactly equal to the amount of Coins I have, I will end up with a balance of Coins that is unusable unless I buy 500 more Coins. That means that Amazon Coins is a really a kind of low-commitment subscription service because in order to use up your Coins you'll have to buy more Coins or manage to buy something exactly equal to your remaining balance
