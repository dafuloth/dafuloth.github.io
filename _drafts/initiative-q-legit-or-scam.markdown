*TL:DR;* I really don't know, but I figure *what have I got to lose?* It only wants my name and email address. You can "secure" a maximum of \~Q130,000 but you start with 10% of that and can get more by inviting other people. If you don't want to invite anyone, that's fine and only that initial 10% is reserved.
