## Failing Faster

That's not pessimism speaking. A long time ago, an [Extra Credits episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDjrOaoHz9s) introduced me to the idea. It's an idea that really resonates with me because I feel that it identifies my greatest flaw.

The video uses the term in the context of design but I think that it can apply more broadly than that. It applies to life too.

I really don't know when to quit. Perhaps I don't really know how. In a way, it's been the story of my life.

Failing faster could mean I'll get more done. Determination in following a particular path can be a good thing... but when it goes too far, it's tunnel vision and isolation.

I've now been living with CFS/ME for about 10 years. This whole time I've been trying to finish my degree but the illness has made it impossible. I've gone and done other things in that time but I've always gone back to trying to study and finish what I started. However, it's clearly not working. I need to try something else.

I wonder how much more I might have achieved if I'd been less myopic.

Whatever I decide to do, I may have to finish off the degree at some point. There were reasons/circumstances, and not just blind determination, behind why I stuck with it for as long as I did. The short version is that the degree was Plan A, and I was already too far along to be able to back out. The only out is through. Switching to an apprenticeship was a potential Plan B but due to the work I've already put into the degree, I'm technically overqualified. I plan to keep monitoring that situation as I'd be really keen to get onto an apprenticeship if I can.

Thinking about the more immediate future, hopefully I manage to secure that internship I applied for. It'll be closer towards what I had wanted for a career and so be preferable to the retail job. I got through the initial sift and have a video interview next.
