Jekyll is wonderful. When GitHub Pages launched, it was exactly what I was looking for. What I felt was missing was decent CMS for writing, managing and updating posts.  I found it was awkward having to write, commit and push to GitHub everytime I wanted to posting something on my blog. Writing was what I wanted to do and so it was what I wanted to focus on. First I tried prose.io but found it too simplistic. Now I'm using Siteleaf and I don't think I'll ever want to leave...

### About Jekyll...
It's lightweight and is quite easy to use, after some setup and configuration. When all I want is somewhere to write stuff it's perfect. Before static site generators were a thing, popular ways to have blog were sites like Blogger or WordPress.

Jekyll has changed everything. Unlike Blogger, I feel a greater sense of ownership and my blog truly feels like it's *mine*. And unlike WordPress, Jekyll is lighter and doesn't come with all the WordPress baggage.

In short, with Blogger I didn't feel like I have enough control, and while WordPress gave me full control over all aspects of my blog it was overkill for what I wanted to do.

###Why Jekyll
If not for Jekyll, in time I might have begrudgingly gone with WordPress. But more on the "overkill" aspect. I'm mainly writing static text-based posts so having a dynamic blog (i.e. WordPress) that's backed by a database *is* overkill.
